In this project, a TX/RX communication system is designed where the transmitter section comprises a polyphase filter bank, scrambler, interleaver, burst-formatter, and the receiver section contains the frequency corrector, de-interleaver, descrambler, and signal reconstructor. The communication system was designed assuming the practical communication channel where the channel adds noise of different SNRs to the transmitted signal.
